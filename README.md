# Exploratory-Data-Analysis
Explores employee retention dynamics through data analysis. Visualizes salary impact and department correlation. Builds a logistic regression model to predict retention, with accuracy evaluation.
### Step 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Loaded HR dataset and visualized variable correlations using a heatmap. The goal was to understand relationships between features before proceeding with further analysis.

### Step 2: Impact of Employee Salaries on Retention
Plotted bar charts depicting the influence of salaries and departments on employee retention. The visualizations provide insights into how these factors may affect whether employees leave or stay.

### Step 3: Logistic Regression Model
Built a logistic regression model using relevant features such as satisfaction level, last evaluation, and more. Categorical variables were one-hot encoded, and the dataset was split for training and testing.

### Step 4: Model Evaluation
Assessed the model's accuracy by predicting on the test set. The logistic regression achieved a 78% accuracy. The classification report details precision, recall, and F1-score for both retained and left classes, offering a comprehensive performance overview.
